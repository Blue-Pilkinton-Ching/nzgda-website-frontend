      <H2>Who is HEIHEI?</H2>

      <P>
        HEIHEI is brought to you by a mighty tag team duo of NZ on Air and TVNZ,
        who both recognise the importance of embracing our cultural identity and
        developing kids’ curiosity and knowledge, particularly at a young age.
        We know a brighter, more colourful future starts with our tamariki. The
        more confident and accepting our children are, the better our nation can
        become. HEIHEI is the home of content made by some of our best producers
        and storytellers from all across New Zealand. They are committed to
        telling New Zealand stories that will spark children’s imaginations and
        we’re proud to feature their work on HEIHEI.
      </P>
      <H2>What is HEIHEI?</H2>
      <P>
        Imagine a place where our tamariki can see and hear themselves
        celebrated. A place that invites their culture, communities, life
        experiences and accents to be reflected back at them. HEIHEI is a bright
        and cheerful streaming platform filled exclusively with safe,
        age-appropriate content. It is packed full of stuff that speaks to those
        young at heart — a growing, organised catalogue of locally-made and
        handpicked international shows, stories, games and music. We also hold
        exciting competitions, with great prizes to be won. Through HEIHEI, our
        kids will learn. They will enjoy. And they will grow It’s free and
        ad-free. Yes, you read that right. You can start watching, listening and
        playing now!
      </P>
      <H2>Why HEIHEI?</H2>
      <P>
        Shouldn’t the question be, “Why not?” Why shouldn’t our children have
        access to diverse local media made specifically for them? Stories are
        vital for the development of identity and imagination. Stories relevant
        to their age and culture should be available to all New Zealand
        children. Children of all backgrounds, ethnicities and abilities should
        see and hear themselves reflected positively in local content. Plus,
        it’s only fair our kids get a turn, right? This is why handing them a
        digital content menu — filled with appetising, age-appropriate
        selections for their eyeballs and brains — makes sense. And who knows —
        you might like the stuff on HEIHEI just as much as them! Also, our
        platform is completely safe and you don’t have to worry about them
        somehow unlocking codes and watching stuff meant only for adults. So sit
        down and enjoy HEIHEI: a reliable place to satisfy your child’s hunger
        for quality digital screen entertainment.
