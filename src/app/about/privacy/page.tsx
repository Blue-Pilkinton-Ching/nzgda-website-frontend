      <H2>HOUSE RULES</H2>
      <P>
        Like anything, there are a few rules around using our websites and apps.
        Please read our General House Rules and Social House Rules at
        http://tvnz.co.nz/community/our-house-rules-415803.
      </P>
      <H2>PRIVACY POLICY</H2>
      <P>
        Your privacy is really important to us. We always want you to feel safe,
        so whenever TVNZ collects and uses your personal information, we comply
        with New Zealand&apos;s Privacy Act. It&apos;s an important law that
        includes a bunch of rules and principles designed to protect your
        privacy. When we talk about our “site” or “sites” in this privacy
        policy, we mean both our websites and our apps (e.g., TVNZ On Demand and
        HEIHEI or any other sites we provide). This Privacy Policy tells you
        what information we collect, and what we can do with it. If you
        don&apos;t agree to the way we collect and use your personal
        information, or anything else in this Privacy Policy, please stop using
        our sites and de-register if you&apos;d like us to delete your personal
        info (see below for more info on that).
      </P>
      <H2>What information do we collect?</H2>
      <P>
        We collect a range of personal, technical and general information,
        including: - Personal details you give us by filling in forms on our
        sites (like when you register your details, or enter a competition) -
        Records of any communication between us - Details about how you use our
        sites like when you visit, where you are, what you look at and how you
        got there (like if you clicked through from an email we&apos;ve sent or
        an online ad) - Computer information like your IP address, operating
        system and browser type.
      </P>
      <H2>How do we use your information?</H2>
      <P>
        Information we collect from you or about you is essential for us to run
        our sites and make sure that content is relevant and delivered in the
        best way for you and your computer (or other device you&apos;re using).
        From time to time TVNZ will use third parties to provide services to us
        or on our behalf in connection with our sites. This might include
        sending service emails for us, or collecting and storing information. In
        these cases we may need to share information we&apos;ve collected about
        you with those suppliers. We&apos;ll make sure that these suppliers take
        good care of your personal information, and only use it for the purposes
        in this Privacy Policy (unless we expressly get your permission for them
        to use it for another purpose).
      </P>
      <H2>
        We (or our suppliers) will use and store your information for the
        following purposes:
      </H2>
      <P>
        <ol className="list-outsid list-decimal marker:font-medium">
          <li>
            To make things better for you We use what we know about you to
            improve the way we deliver our services to you. We might display
            shows we think you&apos;ll like, make recommendations and let you
            save your favourite settings and shows. It&apos;s also handy for
            system admin.
          </li>
          <li>
            To communicate with you and support your use of the services We use
            your details to let you know about updates to our site or services,
            to provide technical support, or to reply to any questions you have.
            If you opt in to hear more from us, we also use them to contact you
            about new shows and other things we think you&apos;ll like.
            Sometimes you might also opt in to hear more from our advertisers,
            in which case we&apos;ll pass your details on to them so they can
            contact you directly.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make our sites better We use your information to look at site
            traffic, analyse trends and generally help us build a big picture
            view of how the site is working. These insights are important
            because they help us to make the site better for you and our
            advertisers. One of the ways we collect this information is by
            Nielsen//NetRatings software. This is a service used by lots of New
            Zealand websites to anonymously collect web statistics, like the
            number of people who visit the site, the number of pages viewed and
            how long users spend on the site. Nielsen//NetRatings will also
            randomly ask visitors to complete anonymous short site surveys.
            Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics are other pieces of software we
            use that do the same sort of thing. These pieces of software work by
            storing a cookie or token in your browser or app (if you&apos;ve
            enabled cookies) which contains a unique identifier to track the
            number of unique visitors to our site. Don&apos;t worry though,
            these systems don&apos;t identify you personally or store any
            personal info, unless you have agreed directly with the provider.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make advertising more relevant It&apos;s good for everyone if we
            can show you ads that you&apos;re likely to be interested in. There
            are some different ways that we might go about this: - One way is to
            share information about your visit to our sites and other websites
            or apps you&apos;ve looked at on the way. For this to work, we
            (and/or our advertising partners) may need to place a cookie or
            token on your computer or device. To do this, we use Google
            DoubleClick technology and cookies. To opt out of personalised
            Google DoubleClick ads, follow the steps
            at:https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb. - Another way is to
            collect information about you from our advertising partners (or from
            third parties that specialise in helping our advertising partners
            find the right people to show their ads to). This information may be
            matched to our existing information about you so that we better
            understand your interests and can provide more relevant content and
            advertising. If we&apos;re matching personal information, we will
            use a third party and will not share your personal details directly
            with advertisers unless you&apos;ve given us permission to do that.
            We ask our those third parties to take good care of your information
            and where any information matching occurs, we require them to make
            sure that they have the rights to use the other information
            collected from you for that purpose. - Another way is through a
            technology called ad personalisation which works to use or insert
            personal details, such as the name, that you provided to us (i.e.
            during registration), in an advert that is shown to you, or users,
            of your account with us, i.e. in the advert’s graphics or imagery.
            The insertion happens in a similar way to how a mail merge system
            would work, and is done by TVNZ, and/or our third party
            personalisation technology service providers on our behalf, after we
            receive the advert from an advertiser. We do not share your name or
            personal information with any advertiser when we use this type of
            technology, or give an advertiser permission to use your personal
            details. To learn more about interest-based advertising and your
            choices, visit the Digital Advertising Allianc&apos;s Consumer
            Choice page at: http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
          </li>
          <li>
            To provide other specific services Now and then we might need to use
            your information to run a competition or poll you&apos;ve entered or
            for another specific service (eg. games on the site). In those cases
            there might be some additional terms around how we need to use your
            information which we&apos;ll make clear at the time of entry.
          </li>
          <li>
            To comply with the law or enforce the House Rules From time to time
            we may be asked to share information with third parties where we are
            compelled to by law. We may also need to use your information to
            enforce the House Rules or to make sure everyone is following the
            rules.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </P>
      <H2>What happens to your info down the track?</H2>
      <P>
        We only keep your info while it&apos;s useful for personalising your
        TVNZ online experience or delivering other services to you. If you
        de-register, we&apos;ll delete your personal info - that&apos;s all the
        details you gave us when you registered that identifies you personally,
        including your name and email address. However we&apos;ll still keep
        hold of your contact details if we need them for a specific purpose,
        like ongoing correspondence. We may also keep other information, like
        how you&apos;ve used our services, but that would just be anonymous
        data. No one will be able to connect it to you.
      </P>
      <H2>Other things you should know.</H2>
      <P>
        Linking to other sites Our site may contain links to and from websites
        or third party services that aren&apos;t controlled by us. If you follow
        a link to any other website or use such services, you should note that
        they have their own rules around privacy and use. We don&apos;t accept
        any responsibility or liability for anyone else&apos;s policies or for
        any transactions that you enter into with them. 2. Keeping your info
        safe Your information will always be stored securely, either on our
        servers here at TVNZ (100 Victoria Street, Auckland, New Zealand), on
        approved off-premise locations or with third party suppliers under
        contract to TVNZ. 3. Your unique identifier If you register for our
        sites, we&apos;ll assign you something called a &apos;unique
        identifier&apos;. Basically it&apos;s a randomly assigned combination of
        numbers and letters that we use in place of your personal information.
        It allows us to keep your personal details safe while collecting info
        about how you use the site, but we can still match info up to you later
        if we need to. 4. Access to your info We respect your privacy, and the
        law around it. When TVNZ collects and uses any of your personal
        information, we comply with the principles outlined in the Privacy Act
        1993 (New Zealand). Under that law you have the right to see the
        personal information we have about you. You can also ask us to correct
        anything that&apos;s inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant, or
        any personal information that&apos;s misleading. If you&apos;d like
        access to your personal information, please Contact Us at
        https://www.tvnz.co.nz/ondemand/contact-us
